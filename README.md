The IIT students' Hall Management Center (HMC) has requested us to develop the following software to
automate various book-keeping activities associated with its day to day operations.
 After a student takes admission, he/she presents a note from the admission unit, along with his/her
name, permanent address, contact telephone number, and a photograph. He/she is then allotted a
hall, and also a specic room number. A letter indicating this allotted room is issued to the concerned
student.
 Students incur mess charges every month. The mess manager would input to the software the total
charges for each student in a month on mess account.
 Each room has a xed room rent. The newly constructed halls have higher rent compared to some of
the older halls. Twin sharing rooms have lower rent.
 Each hall provides certain amenities to the students such as reading rooms, play rooms, TV room, etc.
A xed amount is levied on each student on this count.
 The total amount collected from each student of a hall towards mess charges is handed over to the
mess manager every month. For this, the computer needs to print a sheet with the total amount due to
each mess manager is printed. Printed cheques are issued to each manager and signatures are obtained
from them on the sheet.
 Whenever a student comes to pay his dues, his total due is computed as the sum of mess charge,
amenity charge, and room rent.
 The students should be able to raise various types of complaints using a web browser in their room
or in the Lab. The complaints can be repair requests such as fused lights, non-functional water taps,
non-functional water lters, room repair, etc. They can also register complaints regarding the behavior
of attendants, mess staff, etc. For this round-the-clock operation of the software is required.
 The HMC receives an annual grant from the Institute for staff salary and the upkeep of the halls and
gardens. The HMC chairman should be provided support for distribution of the grant among the
different halls. The Wardens of different halls should be able to enter their expenditure details against
the allocations.
 The controlling warden should be able to view the overall room occupancy.
 The warden of each hall should be able to nd out the occupancy of his hall. He should also be able to
view the complaints raised by the students and post his Action Taken Report (ATR) to each complaint.
 The halls employ attendants and gardeners. These temporary employees receive a xed pay on a per
day basis. The Hall clerk enters any leave taken by an attendant or a gardener from at the terminal
located at the hall office. At the end of every month a consolidated list of salary payable to each
employee of the hall along with cheques for each employee is printed out.
 The HMC incurs petty expenses such as repair works carried out, news paper and magazine subscrip-
tions, etc. It should be possible to enter these expenses.
 Whenever a new staff is recruited his details including his daily pay is entered. Whenever a staff leaves,
it should be possible to delete his records.
 The warden should be able to view the statement of accounts any time. The warden would take a print
out of the annual consolidated statement of accounts, sign and submit it to the Institute administration
for approval and audit verication.
The software should be very secure to prevent the possibility of various types of frauds and nancial
irregularities.
